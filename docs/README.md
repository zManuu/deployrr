# Deployrr

> The all-in-one tool for quickly setting up configurable deployments and whole environments.

## Introduction

Whilst setting up a new project, you might often find yourself in a position where you need some kind of **automated deployment** on a remote server.  
Deployrr helps you by providing a configurable, extensible deployment process.  

Similar to the definition of a pipeline, the deployment is configured in one file containing a set of tasks or steps to execute.
The recommended approach is to embed Deployrr into your pipeline.  
An example:
